# FinanceDataAnalysis

Real-Time Streaming of Financial Data with Apache Spark (Python)


Overview

This project demonstrates the analysis and visualization of financial data using PySpark and various Python libraries. The Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab) provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the environment, fetching financial data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training machine learning models.

Prerequisites
•	Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from python.org.
•	Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab: The project is designed to be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment. If you prefer using Google Colab, simply open the notebook in Colab.
•	Internet Connection: The notebook fetches financial data using an external API, so an internet connection is required.

Open Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab:
•	If using Jupyter Notebook: open terminal and change directory to the directory of downloaded file and execute

> jupyter notebook 

•	If using Google Colab, upload the notebook (financial.ipynb) to your Google Drive and open it with Colab.

Run All Cells:
Open the notebook and run all cells. The notebook will automatically download and set up PySpark, fetch financial data, execute data analysis, and display the results.
